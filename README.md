# 🌾FarmAssist - AI-Powered Agricultural Assistant

*FarmAssist* is a smart agriculture-focused web application designed to *enhance the crop yield and decision-making* of farmers by leveraging AI, crop recommendation systems, soil management guidance, and plant disease detection. The platform also features *voice-enabled interaction* to assist farmers with limited literacy.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many farmers, especially in rural areas, face challenges due to:

- Lack of knowledge about the best crop to grow based on soil and weather.
- Difficulty identifying crop diseases in time.
- Limited access to expert agricultural advice.
